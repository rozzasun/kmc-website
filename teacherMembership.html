          <h1>Teacher Membership and Procedures</h1>

          <h5>Teacher Membership</h5>
          <p>In order to have your students perform at our Sunday concerts, both you and your student must complete and
            mail in membership forms and fees for the current season.</p>

          <p>Please download and print the Teacher’s Membership Application form and mail it with your payment
            to:<br>
            <p class="text-center">
              Sherry Lu<br>
              2 Nanook Crescent<br>
              Kanata, Ontario<br>
              K2L 2A7
            </p>
          </p>

          <p>
            Teachers may then register their students for performance by submitting a Concert Request Form (see further deatils on the form itself).
          </p>

          <h5>Concert Request Procedure</h5>
          <p>
            When you submit your application, please add a note with your email indicating the number of students you are submitting, their
            total performance time, and whether you are planning to attend the concert. SStudents are allowed up to 2 selections per concert providing
            they follow time limits on the Concert Request Form.
          </p>

          <h5>Assignments</h5>
          <p>
            There are usually two and sometimes three concerts scheduled on a concert Sunday beginning at 2:15PM. Students
            and
            their teachers will be assigned a particular concert time which
            will be posted on the web site nder Upcoming Concert Info one week prior to the concert.
          </p>

          <p>
            In view of the number of students and teachers that we serve, it is not possible to accommodate requests for
            specific concert times. Please ensure that your students
            understand this need for availability on their part before you submit their concert request form.
          </p>

          <h5>Marking</h5>
          <p>
            All attending teachers are asked to mark the performances. Teacher marking sheets will be available at the
            desk
            and should be put into the envelope for the Director of Scholarships
            after the concert. Please sign your name to the front of this envelope to record your participation as a marking teacher.
            Generally, the marks should follow the music festival system, using the range from the
            high
            70’s to the low 90’s, with the marks mainly ranging from 80 to 88%.
            Please mark ALL performances unless otherwise indicated on the teacher marking sheet.
          </p>

          <p>For information regarding our Graded Scholarships see the <a href="awardsAndScholarships.html">Scholarship
              Information tab</a>.</p>

          <p>
            Please remember to advise families that are new to our concerts that it is important to stay for the
            entire
            concert to provide an audience for other club members. In the unusual
            case where someone must enter or exit the hall during the concert, please advise them to do so very
            discreetly,
            and only between performances.
          </p>

          <p>
            All performance material must be well prepared, preferably memorized, prior to each performance. Students
            should
            be reminded to dress appropriately.
