          <h2>Membership</h2>
          <p>In order to perform in our concerts, a Student Membership Fee of $75.00 is required for each season, to be paid by e-Transfer <b>at least two weeks</b> prior to the student's first performance.  
            There is an additional $30.00 fee for each additional performing family member. Also, students wishing to perform on a second instrument may do so
            with the addition of a $30.00 Second Instrument fee.            
          </p>

          <h2>Payment Details</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Step 1: Send an e-Transfer for the membership fee(s) to <a href="mailto: kanatamusicclub@gmail.com">kanatamusicclub@gmail.com</a>. In the message line of the e-Transfer include the <b>student(s) proper performing</b> name as well the <b>Teacher's name</b>.
              It is important that the student's chosen performing name is <b>consistently</b> used in this payment memo as well as on the Concert Request Form. Please clearly indicate the specifics of any additional fees
              and for which student it pertains.
            </li>
            <li>Step 2: Forward a copy of the e-Transfer to the student's teacher.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>General points for Teachers</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>There is no membership fee for Teachers.</li>
            <li>Participation by a teacher in any one concert will be held to a maximum of 20 minutes.  Once that amount of performance time is reached, additional students from that teacher will likely be placed in the following concert.</li>
            <li>Teachers are asked to help track the payment of fees for their students.  Note that the students will forward a copy of their membership payment (which should be made at least two weeks prior to their first performance of the season.)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Application Procedure</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Application should be made by the teacher using the Concert Request Form from our website.  This form should be sent to <a href="mailto: kmcconcerts@yahoo.com">kmcconcerts@yahoo.com</a> a minimum of 3 weeks prior to the concert date, 5 weeks before the January concert.</li>
            <li>A notice of receipt of the Concert Request Form will be sent to the teacher.</li>
            <li>Students may perform one piece or two pieces if they are of relatively short duration. See specific time limits (according to Grade levels) on the Concert Request Form.</li>
            <li>Memorization is not mandatory, but is strongly recommended.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Notification of Specific Concert Times</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>There are often several separate concerts scheduled on our concert Sundays.</li>
            <li><b>Every effort to avoid special requests for specific concert times must be made by all members and teachers.</b></li>
            <li>Specific concert times as well as the programmes for the upcoming concerts will be posted on our website one week prior to the concert under <a href='concertTimesAndMessages.html'>Upcoming Concert Posting.</a></li>
            <li>Printed programs will not be distributed at the concert venue.  If a printed copy is desired, please print from the posting on the website.</li>
