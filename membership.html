            Application Form</a>
          <h1>Family Membership</h1>
          <p>To play at our concerts students must first purchase a family membership.
            Family memberships need to be renewed each season. This membership entitles
            you and your family to attend all concerts, and to play at concerts as agreed
            upon with your teacher. If a student plans to perform in more than one discipline, a double instrument
            membership fee is required (see form).
          </p>

          <p>Please download and print the Family Membership Application form.
            This should be mailed, with payment, prior to your first performance
            to our Treasurer:
          </p>

          </p>

          <h1>Notes to Students and Families</h1>
          <p>
            To perform in the Kanata Music Club concerts, both you and your teacher must have applied for membership
            in the club for the current season. A concert request form will be sent by your teacher to Kanata Music
            Club to register you for the concert.
          </p>

          <p>
            Several separate concerts are scheduled on any given concert Sunday beginning at 2:15PM. Your specific
            concert time will be posted one week prior to the concert on our web page titled Upcoming Concert Info.
            Be sure that you are available for the duration of the afternoon before you and your teacher agree to
            submit an application for a concert, as no special requests for specific concert times can be guaranteed.
          </p>

          <p>
            All performance material must be well prepared, preferably memorized, prior to each performance. Scholarship
            repertoire must be performed from memory.
          </p>

          <p>Students should wear clothing suitable for public performance. No jeans, please.</p>

          <p>
            Participants are expected to stay for the entire duration of the concert, providing a thoughtful and
            attentive
            audience for the other performing members.
            Families with small children should discuss the need for quiet listening before the concert begins. In the
            unusual case when someone must enter or exit
            the hall during the concert, please do so very discreetly between performances. Distracting noises and
            movement
            during a performance can upset both the
            performer and other audience members.
          </p>

          <p>There is no admission fee at the door. All interested guests and family are welcome free of charge.</p>
